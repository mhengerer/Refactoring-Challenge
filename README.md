# Refactoring-Challenge

## Description

In this project I thoroughly reviewed the code and went through it with a fine toothed comb. When found I corrected inappropriate or indescript elemtents and replaced them with elements that had semantic meaning.
This project helped me practice analyzing content to understand what the element means and also better understand selectors in CSS.
